# This is a script to install a development environment without Vagrant, if you
# want to use your own VM, for example.
#
# Before this script is run, make sure to configure the following:
#  * A user 'infra' exists
#  * The 'kninfra' repository is cloned into /vagrant, and owned by the user
#    infra.
#
# You can do this with the following commands (as root):
#    adduser infra
#    git clone https://github.com/karpenoktem/kninfra.git /vagrant
#    chown -R infra:infra /vagrant
#
# Then run this script.

# Fail on errors.
